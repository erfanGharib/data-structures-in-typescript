# Data Structures in Typescript
[What are Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

Common Data structures written in Typescript, implemented with Classes.<br>

## [Array](./array)
Runtime Complexities:
- Find by index O(1)
- Find by value O(n)
- Delete value O(n)
- Add value O(n)

## [Linked List](./linkedList)
Runtime Complexities:
- Find by index O(n)
- Find by value O(n)
- Add first / last O(1)
- Add Middle O(n)
- Delete first O(1)
- Delete last O(n)
- Delete middle O(n)
- Reverse O(n)

## [Stack](./stack)
Stack can be implemented with arrays and linkedList.
Arrays in this case.<br>

Runtime Complexities:
- All operations are O(1)
